        <h1>Tyler Thibeau's Biography</h1>
    <p>
        Hello, my name is Tyler Thibeau, and I am an Information Management and Technology major in the <strong>I-School</strong> concentrating in information security management.
    </p>

     <p>
         I have a strong interest in the cyber security field/topic and Iâ€™m hoping after college I will be able to obtain a job in a related field.Both of my parents work in IT so my passion for IT and cyber security grew from them.
    </p>
    <h2>Personal Info</h2>
    <p>
        Outside of school, I enjoy things such as traveling, snowboarding, and playing golf in the summer. My favorite TV show would have to be Breaking Bad due to the storyline changing so much from the start to the end. I am hoping I can learn a lot about front-end web developing from this class and maybe look into taking a second concentration.
